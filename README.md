# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** journey! This is my very first year participating in the annual coding event, and I'm excited to unwrap each day's puzzle like it's a gift under the tree! 🎁

Advent of Code is a 25-day holiday tradition for programmers, where puzzles are released each day leading up to Christmas. The challenge helps improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and, of course, have a lot of fun along the way! 🌟

## 🎅 My Mission

This year, I'm diving in headfirst to solve all the puzzles and document my progress as I go! I’m hoping to get better with algorithms and programming while also enjoying the holiday cheer. 🎉

## 🧑‍💻 Repository Overview

Here’s how I’ve organized my Advent of Code 2024 solutions:

- **Year 2024**: Each day’s challenge has its own folder where you’ll find my Python solutions.
- **Progress Log**: I’ll be keeping track of how I’m doing each day and the fun thoughts I have along the way (because, let’s face it, some puzzles are tricky!).

❄️ Progress Updates
I'll be updating this section as I go, but here's how it’s looking so far:

- Day 1: Solved! 🎉 (Part 1 and Part 2)
- Day 2: Solved! 📝 (Part 1 and Part 2), definitely tougher than Day 1
- Day 3: To be tackled tomorrow! ✨
